## üí° Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from the increasing need for better food safety and regulation compliance. With globalization, food products are crossing borders more frequently, making it essential to ensure that food contents comply with health regulations in various countries. This project aims to leverage AI to assist food inspectors by providing an intelligent tool that can analyze food packaging contents, identify hazardous ingredients, and determine if any contents are banned in specific countries.

## üéÆ What it does üìä Features

The Snowflake Arctic-Food-Pharmacist Chatbot is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot designed to read and understand food packaging contents. The key features include:

- **Chat Interaction**: Users can ask the chatbot about food contents and get informed responses regarding their safety and legality.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload PDF, TXT, or image files containing food packaging contents. The chatbot will extract and analyze the text.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: The chatbot uses AI to determine if any ingredients are hazardous to health or banned in any country.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Users can adjust model parameters such as temperature and top_p to fine-tune the AI's response.
- **Clear Chat Functionality**: A clear chat button that resets the chat history and deletes the uploaded file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

The Snowflake Arctic-Food-Pharmacist Chatbot was built using the following steps:

1. **Setting Up Streamlit**: Streamlit was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use in building interactive web applications.
2. **Integrating Replicate API**: The Replicate API was used to interact with the Snowflake Arctic model, enabling the chatbot functionality.
3. **File Handling**: Added file upload capabilities to allow users to submit food packaging contents in PDF, TXT, or image formats.
4. **Text Extraction**: Implemented text extraction using PyMuPDF for PDFs and Tesseract OCR for images.
5. **Tokenization**: Used Hugging Face's Transformers library for tokenizing text inputs to ensure they meet model requirements.
6. **Model Parameter Adjustments**: Provided sliders for users to adjust temperature and top_p parameters for the AI model.
7. **UI/UX Enhancements**: Designed a clean and user-friendly interface, including the chat window and control elements.
